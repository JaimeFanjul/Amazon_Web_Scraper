# Amazon_Web_Scraper
This is a simple Amazon scraper written in Python. It can fetch products title, dates, features, rating,  etc. Pandas dataframe has been used to stored the data. 

It is not easy to get Applications approved for Amazon´s API therefore I created this tool. The goal of this project is to become as minimalistic as possible while still having all the needed functionality so that its easy to add code to it! Any ⭐️ or contribution is appreciated if you like the project 🤘
